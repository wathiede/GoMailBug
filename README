This project contains similar address extraction implementations in python and
go.  You pass in a glob pattern for individual mail files and an output file
and it will extract all To: and CC: fields and write the following to the
output file specified:

<name>|<email address>|<filename>

This makes it easy to diff the outputs of the two implementations and gives
you the source mail file if you need to investigate further.

compare.sh takes a single arg, a file glob pattern, runs each implementation,
and diffs the output.

The python implementation requires Google's python-gflags library from:
