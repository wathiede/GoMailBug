This project contains similar implementations in python and go.  You pass in a
glob pattern and and output file and it will extract all To: and CC: fields
and write the following to the output file specified:

<name>|<email address>|<filename>

This makes it easy to diff the outputs of the two implementations and gives
you the file if you need to investigate further.

compare.sh takes a single arg, a file glob pattern, runs each implementation,
and diffs the output.

The python implementation requires Google's python-gflags library from:
http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags/
